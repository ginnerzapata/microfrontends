# microfrontends

first project in the microfrontend course

In order to run this project, `cd` into each miniapp (example: `cd container`) and install the dependencies `npm i`.

In order to run the projects, use the command `npm run start` in each folder. `cart` and `products` can work by themselves but the `container` will need `cart` and `products` running in order to use the dependencies.
